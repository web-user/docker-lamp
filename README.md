# docker-lamp
Docker example with Apache, MySql, PhpMyAdmin and Php

I use docker-compose as an orchestrator. To run these containers:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

```
docker-compose build
```

```
docker-compose up -d
```


```
docker ps,  sudo docker exec -i -t CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
```


```
mysql -u user -p
```


```
docker stop CONTAINER_ID
```


```
docker rm CONTAINER_ID
```


```
docker-compose build
```


That's it!
